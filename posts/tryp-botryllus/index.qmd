# Introduction

Trypsinization of cell cultures is a common method use in cell biology to disassociate adherent cells *in vitro* from the vessel in which they are being cultured for the purpose of passaging the cells, meaning division of the cell population and reseeding into new vessels. 

The process of cell disassociation for primary epithelial cells of *Botryllus schlosseri* must continue to be refined.
