Here I both describe the procedure that occurred for epithelial tissue isolation from *Botryllus schlosseri* for trial 16 and maintain this document as a living log for further updates regarding those cultures.

# General Information


## Date and Time

August 22, 2023

-   Preparation of epithelial isolation began on 08/22/23 with the quarantine period. Individual S085C001 was set in approximately 60 mL of Autoclaved Artificial Seawater - Gentamicin (0.05%).

August 23, 2023: 0 days post seeding (dps)

-   S085C001 was dissected for parental zooids on 08/23/23

-   Zooids were transferred to a 1 mL aliqout of tunicate culture media (TCM) in batches of 10 for all 25 zooids.

-   Zooid tissue was seeded at approximately 5 - 6:50 PM.

-   4 pieces of tissue out of 18 unadhered after seeding

-   Rinsed off all zooid pieces with 2 mL of TCM wash before allowing tissue to adhere.

-   Flask placed in incubator immediately after seeding.


August 24, 2023: 1 dps

-   

## Source and Handling of Starting Material

-   All tunicates when collected from marina are transported to UWT in 500 mL Nalgene polycarbonate jars filled completely with local marina water. Jars are placed in a cooler to maintain temperature for 30 minute drive back to UWT (from City of De Moines Marina).
-   Upon arrival, tunicates are removed from mussel using a razor blade or kept with substrate and tied to 3'' x 2'' x 1.2 mm glass slide using cotton thread. Tunicates are immediately placed in UWT recirculating artificial seawater system (16 C, 27 PPT).
-   Tunicates are fed every other day (MWF) a mix of commercially available phytoplankton and roti-rich.

- 494.5 mL filtered seawater (~850 mOsmo/kg)
- 500 uL Amphotericin B (250ug/mL stock solution)

## Epithelial Cell Isolation

Be sure to have sufficient stocks of the above three solutions prior to
following the below procedures.

##### 1. The day prior to bud isolation

- Select an individual (one glass slide) with at least 30 zooids completely adhered to the slide. Health score must be 7 and above. Stage does not matter but document the day of dissection.

- Remove individuals from recirculating seawater system 

- Use a razor blade to clean the glass slide

- Spray animal over sink with 70 % ethanol for 5 seconds or until glass slide is completely coated with ethanol

- Rinse animal with autoclaved artificial seawater until no ethanol is observable.

- Place animal in 15 cm glass petri dish containing 60 mL of ASW-G.

- Parafilm and perforate petri dish

- Leave overnight for starvation on lab bench at room temperature.

- Prepare coated plates if needed for the next day.

##### 2. Tissue Dissection

- Remove colony from ASW-G.

- Wash colony and substrate for 10 seconds with 30% ethanol.

- Rinse colony with autoclaved artificial seawater

- Immerse colony in 15 cm diameter, glass dish filled
with ~60 mL of ASW-PSA. For each new colony microdissection, rinse the
15 mL glass plate with 70% ethanol in triplicate, followed by triplicate
rinse of ASW-PSA prior to refilling plate with more ASW-PSA.

- Under stereomicroscope on lab bench take picture of entire colony (all zooids to be dissected with
Excelis camera.

- Record blastogenic stage, zooid number, and health score.

- Using a pair of 31G syringe needles, peel open the tunic and remove
buds. Buds in earlier stages of development (stage A) are more embedded in the tunic than degrading ones (TO). Be sure to not tear the bud itself, this can be done by gently carving the tunic around the bud and then using a blunt portion of the needle to roll the bud out.

- Every time a bud is removed, place it in cell strainer that itself is also immersed in the same 20 mL of ASW-G. Use a clicker to keep track of the number of buds you collected.
  
- Once you have collected a group of 5 or 10 buds in the cell strainer, rinse all buds for 5 seconds with 30% ethanol followed by a 5 second rinse with ASW-PSA.

- Using sterile curved forceps, transfer the group of 5 or 10 buds to a labeled, 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of TCM.

- Transfer all tubes containing bud tissue to the biosaftey
cabinet in TPS for cell seeding.

##### 3. Seeding tissue and cell maintenance

- In the biosaftey cabinet, use a 1000 uL pipette tip aspirate into the solution to get the buds back into suspension and transfer to plastic 60 mm petri dish.

- Using the same 1000 uL pipette tip transfer buds one at a time to a fresh culturing dish. Make sure to transfer only a small amount of liquid (about a drop) per bud.

- Using the same pipette tip, remove any excess liquid from the culturing dish.

- While you repeat the above two steps with your other samples, let the dishes you previously seeded to dry for about ~5 minutes or until there is no visible liquid left.

- If there is still liquid in culturing dish, use aspirator to remove any excess to make sure tissue sticks to dish.

- Once all the wells are dry, add 2 mL of TCM to T25 flasks. Be sure to not touch the tip of the pipette to the wells and to have the lowest flow possible when adding in media to not agitate the tissue and have it unadhere from plate.

- Incubate cells at 20 C 

- Replace 100% of the TCM every 2-3 days.
