# General Information

## Date and Time

August 30, 2023

-   Preparation of epithelial isolation began on 08/30/23.

-   Individual S105C002 was subdivided. Using a razor blade, the portion of the colony that was not adhered to the glass slide was removed and tied to slide S105C003.

-   Glass slide S105C002 was cleaned thouroughly as described in protocol below.

-   Individual S105C002 was set in 100 mL of Autoclaved Artificial Seawater - Gentamicin (0.05%) (ASW-G) for a 14 hour quarantine period.

August 31, 2023: 0 days post seeding (dps)

-   S105C001 was dissected for zooids on 08/31/23

-   Dissections began at 2:40 PM and ended at 6 PM

-   Zooids were transferred to an aliqout of 1 mL tunicate culture media (TCM) in batches of 10.

-   Zooid tissue was seeded at approximately 7:20 PM. 10 zooids per well.

-   S105C002 was dissected for intact ampullae on at about 4 PM as well as blood cells.
  -   Ampullae and blood cells were added directly to aliquot of media. Ampullae were added by scooping. Blood cells were added by using the syringe plunger on the insulin needle. Once a sufficient amount of material was gathered, material was spun down for 5 seconds with mini centrifuge (2000 x g). Excess media was removed using 1000 uL pipette tip. Media was replaced with fresh 1 mL aliquot.

-   500 uL of TCM was added to all wells in 12-well cell culture flasks at x PM.

## Source and Handling of Starting Material

#### Intake Procedure

-   All tunicates when collected from marina are transported to UWT in 500 mL Nalgene polycarbonate jars filled completely with local marina water. Jars are placed in a cooler to maintain temperature for 30 minute drive back to UWT (from City of De Moines Marina).

-   Upon arrival, tunicates are removed from mussel using a razor blade or kept with substrate and tied to 3'' x 2'' x 1.2 mm glass slide using cotton thread. Tunicates are immediately placed in UWT recirculating artificial seawater system (16 C, 27 PPT).

-   Tunicates are fed every other day (MWF) a mix of commercially available phytoplankton and roti-rich.

-   Colony S105C002 was mechanically subdivided using a razor blade on 08/20/23 directly before submersion in ASW-G overnight.

#### Defining Health Score

-   0-dead (no bloodflow)

-   2-very bad w heartbeat

-   4- poor (amp retract, high pigm, tunic puffy)

-   6-fair (part poor)

-   8- good (most amp extended, normal tunic & pigm)

-   10- great (all amp extended, tunic flat, clear, normal pigm)


#### Colony Information At Dissection (08/31/23)


| colony_id | establishment_date | sampling_location                 | stage | zooid_num | health_score |
|-----------|----------:|-----------|----------:|-----------|-----------|
| S105C002  |           08/25/23 | De Moines Marina (47.44, -122.34) |    A1 | 49        | 6            |

Animal health score was 10 prior to ASW-G period but  the mechanichal subdivison prior to an ethanol wash and dip disrupted the normal zooid architecture

        -   Consider testing different seeding densities to observe their effects.

## Observations and Growth Monitoring

```         
-   Regularly document your observations, including cell morphology, attachment, aggregation, or any changes in appearance.
-   Include photographs if possible.
```

## Viability and Proliferation

```         
-   Note any signs of cell viability (e.g., cell membrane integrity, absence of debris).
-   Monitor cell proliferation by documenting changes in cell density over time.
```

## pH and Nutrient Levels

```         
-   If possible, measure and record the pH of the medium during the culture.
-   Monitor nutrient consumption by measuring glucose or other nutrients if relevant.
```

## Media Changes and Additions

-   08/31/23: Added 1 mL of media at 0 dps

## Summary of Results and Outcomes

```         
-   Summarize the overall outcome of the experiment, including whether you observed growth, viability, or any other changes.
```

## Notes and Anomalies

- Rinsing animal with ethanol and setting in ASW-G immediately after subdivision disrupts zooid architecture.

## Next Steps and Modifications

As animal was not at least at a health score of 7, need to redo this set up with a healthier animal. Will not subdivide animal again and immediately try to cultue. Give animal at least 2 days to recover from subdivision.

-   Verify salinity using refractometer prior to filtering.

2.  Filter solution through 0.22 um filter unit.

#### Artificial Seawater

36.6 grams (g) of Red Sea Salt per liter to make solution at \~30 ppt.

##### **Artificial Seawater - 0.05% Gentamicin (ASW-G)**

In the biosaftey cabinet add together the following:

-   500 mL of artificial seawater (\~850 mOsmo/kg)
    -   Does not have to be autoclaved or filtered
-   238.8 uL gentamicin (50 mg/mL stock)

##### **Artificial Seawater - 1% Pen/Strep & 0.01% Amp B (ASW-PSA)**

## Cell Isolation

Be sure to have sufficient stocks of the above three solutions prior to following the below procedures.

##### 1. The day prior to bud isolation

-   Select an individual (one glass slide) with at least 30 zooids completely adhered to the slide. Health score must be 7 and above. Stage does not matter but document the day of dissection.

-   Remove individuals from recirculating seawater system

-   ***Individual subdivided to retain only attached portion of colony.***

-   Use a razor blade to clean the glass slide

-   Spray animal over sink with 70 % ethanol for 5 seconds or until glass slide is completely coated with ethanol

-   Rinse animal with autocalved artificial seawater until no ethanol is observable.

-   ***Place animal in 15 cm glass petri dish containing 100 mL of ASW-G.***

-   Parafilm and perforate petri dish

-   Leave overnight for starvation on lab bench at room temperature.

##### 2.  Tissue Dissection

-   Remove colony from ASW-G.

-   Wash colony and substrate for 10 seconds with 30% ethanol.

-   Rinse colony with autoclaved artificial seawater

-   Immerse colony in 15 cm diameter, glass dish filled with \~60 mL of ASW-PSA. For each new colony microdissection, rinse the 15 mL glass plate with 70% ethanol in triplicate, followed by triplicate rinse of ASW-PSA prior to refilling plate with more ASW-PSA.

-   Under stereomicroscope on lab bench take picture of entire colony (all zooids to be dissected with Excelis camera.

-   Record blastogenic stage, zooid number, and health score.

-   Using a pair of 31G syringe needles, peel open the tunic and remove zooids. 

-   Every time a zooid is removed, place it in cell strainer that itself is also immersed in the same 20 mL of ASW-G. Use a clicker to keep track of the number of zooud you collected.

-   Once you have collected a group of 10 zooids in the cell strainer, rinse all zooids for 5 seconds with 30% ethanol followed by a 5 second rinse with ***autoclaved artificial seawater***.

-   Use same pair of insulin needles to transfer over the zooids to the 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of TCM. This can be done by placing the cell strainer in ASW-PSA under the stereomicroscope and carefully rolling the zooids onto one of the needles. Make sure not to burst them.

-   Transfer all tubes containing bud tissue to the biosaftey cabinet in TPS for cell seeding.

##### 3. Coat well plates

Cultrex Basement Membrane Extract (BME) and Reduced Growth Factor Basement Membrane Extract (RFG BME) Coating Procedure:Cultrex Coating Procedure:

<!-- -->

1.  Thaw Cultrex RGF BME and Cultrex BME overnight at 2-8 °C. Refrigerator temperatures may vary, therefore it is recommended to keep BME on ice in a refrigerator during the thawing process. Thawed BME solidifies quickly at the temperatures above 15 °C; when working with extract, keep it on ice to prevent untimely gelling.
2.  Mix Cultrex RGF BME by slowly pipetting solution up and down; be careful not to introduce air bubbles.
3.  Dilute Cultrex RGF BME and Cultrex BME to desired concentration in cold serum-free medium. A 1:100 dilution is recommended for the propagation of primary cells. Empirical determination of the optimal coating concentration for your application may be required.
4.  Add a sufficient amount of solution to cover the entire growth surface area. A volume of 300 μL per cm^2^ is recommended.
5.  Incubate coated object at room temperature for one hour.
6.  Aspirate coating solution and immediately plate cells. Do not allow coated surface to dry out.

For both Cultrex BME and RGF BME we will be coating two 3.8 cm^2^ wells (and accounting for 10% volume loss):

$$ 300 uL/cm^2 * 3.8 cm^2 / well * 2wells * 0.1 = 2,508 uL$$

Therefore need:

25.1 uL of cultrex and 2,482 uL of serum-free media.

Serum-free media:

-   65.71% L-15 = 1,630.9 uL

-   31.27% FSW = 776.1 uL

-   1.44% HEPES Buffer = 35.7 uL

-   1.44% Pen-Strep = 35.7 uL

-   0.14% Amphotericin B = 3.6 uL

Then to each well add 1,140 uL of the diluted substrate solution.

##### 4. Seeding tissue and cell maintenance

-   In the biosaftey cabinet, use a 1000 uL pipette tip aspirate into the solution to get the buds back into suspension and transfer to plastic 60 mm petri dish.

-   Using the same 1000 uL pipette tip transfer buds one at a time to a fresh culturing dish. Make sure to transfer only a small amount of liquid (about a drop) per bud.

-   ***Do not allow wells to dry out***

-   ***Add 0.5-1 mL of TCM to each well.*** Be sure to not touch the tip of the pipette to the wells and to have the lowest flow possible when adding in media to not agitate the tissue and have it unadhere from plate.

-   Incubate cells at 20 C

-   Replace 100% of the TCM every 2-3 days.
