# Initial Schematic

# Suggestions

Dr. Gardell's suggested modifications to design 09/01/23:

  1.  Log distribution of the concentrations.

  2.  qPCR should be left for follow up experiment with better defined (targeted) concentrations and time points. Do not snap freeze tissue for qPCR, alternatively use tissue for:

   a.  Primary epithelial cell culturing to address question regarding stress-induced evolution

   b.  Use for comet assay

  3.  Maintain a traditional LC50 design.

   a.  More concentrations at one time point.

   b.  Time point defined by research goals.

## Modified Design based on suggestions

## Notes and considerations

Not going to be controlling for blastogenic stages

  -   If system is in C2 - D blastogenic stages, seed the primary buds
  
  -   If system is in A1-C1 stages, seed the parental zooids
  
What would the seeding density be?

  -   5-9 zooids (the whole system) in one well -> two 12 well-plates
  
Using well plates, however, we will need to control for evaporation more effectively, currently randomly lose anywhere from 30-50% of the media, drastically causing differences in the osmolarity of the wells.

  -   Improve humidity conditions
  
  -   Add a lot of media from initiation. 3 mL in each well.
  
        -   Ideal to measure media quality.
        
Could be interesting to incorporate in future design, freezing tissue at the end of the exposure and then freezing after seeding. Evaluating differences in gene expression across those time points.
