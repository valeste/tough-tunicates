# Suggestions
Dr. Gardell's suggested modifications to design:

1. Log distribution of the concentrations.
    
  a. i.e. 0, 0.1, 1, 100.
  
2. qPCR should be left for follow up experiment with better defined (targeted) concentrations and time points. Do not snap freeze tissue for qPCR, alternatively use tissue for:
  
  a. Primary epithelial cell culturing to address question regarding stress-induced evolution
    
  b. Use for comet assay
    
3. Maintain a traditional LC50 design.
  
  a. More concentrations at one time point.
    
  i. Time point defined by research goals.
