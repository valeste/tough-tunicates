# Suggestions

Dr. Gardell's suggested modifications to design:

1.  Log distribution of the concentrations.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  i.e. 0, 0.1, 1, 100.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  qPCR should be left for follow up experiment with better defined (targeted) concentrations and time points. Do not snap freeze tissue for qPCR, alternatively use tissue for:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Primary epithelial cell culturing to address question regarding stress-induced evolution

b.  Use for comet assay

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  Maintain a traditional LC50 design.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  More concentrations at one time point.

b.  Time point defined by research goals.
