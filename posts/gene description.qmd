Thank you for providing the data. To help you find gene descriptions for each of these gene symbols, I will create a new table that includes an additional column with the gene descriptions. I'll cross-reference each gene symbol with available databases and provide descriptions accordingly.

I will generate this table and share it with you shortly.

I've compiled the gene descriptions for the gene symbols you provided. Here's the updated table:îˆ†
