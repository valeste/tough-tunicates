## Introduction
This is an example post of the work I did for Assignment 5 for FISH 549 where I generated an exploratory and expository plot of a data set provided by the class.

## Requirements
We will be exploring the data and creating figures using ggplot2.
Below are the packages I need to parse through the data and create plots.

```{r load_pkgs, message=FALSE}
## for reading & writing data
library(here)
library(readr)
## for manipulating data
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(broom)
library(ggpubr)
## for plotting
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data
The data is already in a csv file format so all we need to do is read it in.

### Step 1: Setting the working directory
```{r get_author_data}
## data directory
data_dir <- here("posts", "post-with-code", "data")
```

### Step 2: Reading in the data
The data is already in a "tidy" format, meaning all the variables I need are already in columns.
```{r read_siscowet_data, message=FALSE}
## reading in the data
df <- read.csv(here(data_dir, "siscowet.csv"))

# renaming locID column to Location so that it can display this as my legend title down the line
df <- df %>% rename(Location = locID)
```

### Step 3: Creating an exploratory figure
I want to simply look at the trend of fish weight against fish length.
```{r exploratory_df, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## exploratory plotting
 ggplot(data = df, aes(x = len, y = wgt)) +
  xlab("Total Length (mm)") +
  ylab("Weight (g)") +
  geom_point()

```

### Step 4: Creating my expository figure
I am interested in seeing the relationship of fish weights and lengths by the different catch locations.

Below I am plotting the length and weight data and color coding the points by the four locations. I also have overlapped a linear regression over my data per location with a 95% confidence interval.

```{r expository_df, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## plotting by locations with the addition of a linear regression line
  ggplot(data = df, aes(x = len, y = wgt, color = Location)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Total Length (mm)", y = "Weight (g)") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=TRUE, fullrange=FALSE, level=0.95, aes(fill =Location)) 

```
