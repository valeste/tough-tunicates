# Summary

Pilot study for NiCl~2~ exposures on whole field-sourced *Botryllus schlosseri* colonies. 

## Objectives

-   Promote cell proliferation *in vitro* through the induction of clastogenic damage of epithelial cells derived from *B. schlosseri*.

-   If no changes are observed across the different treatments in this pilot study, identify the ideal sample size, identify manipulations to the independent variables, time or concentration of NiCl~2~. 

# Research Questions

1.    Does an in vivo exposure to NiCl~2~ promote in vitro cellular proliferation of epithelial tissue subsequently seeded post exposure?


2.    What is the rate of cell division that occurs within those first 24 hours?


3.    How does exposure to nickel chloride impact gene expression in epithelial tissue across the different concentrations after 24 hours post exposure in vivo and 76 hours post seeding?


# Suggestions for Experimental Design

Dr. Gardell's suggested modifications to design 09/01/23:

-   Log distribution of the concentrations.

-   qPCR should be left for follow up experiment with better defined (targeted) concentrations and time points. Do not snap freeze tissue for qPCR, alternatively use tissue for:


  -  Primary epithelial cell culturing to address question regarding stress-induced evolution

  -  Use for comet assay



Valerie (UCD) Suggestions 09/23/23: 


-   Seed tissue immediately after dissection to avoid lag time in TCM aliquot.


-   Reduce scale for preliminary trial to avoid 9 hours of micro-dissection time.

## Notes and considerations

Will not control for blastogenic stage at this time.

-   If system is in C2 - D blastogenic stages, seed the primary buds

-   If system is in A1-C1 stages, seed the parental zooids

Tissue seeding density

-   5-9 zooids (one whole system) in one well.

Using well plates, however, we will need to control for evaporation more effectively, currently randomly lose anywhere from 30-50% of the media, drastically causing differences in the osmolarity of the wells.

-   Improve humidity conditions

-   Add a lot of media from initiation. 2 mL in each well.

   -   Ideal to measure media quality.
   
-   Randomize well assignments

-   

Could be interesting to incorporate in future design, freezing tissue at the end of the exposure and then freezing after seeding. Evaluating differences in gene expression across those time points.
