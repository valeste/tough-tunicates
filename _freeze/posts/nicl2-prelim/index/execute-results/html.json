Does an in vivo exposure to NiCl~2~ promote in vitro cellular proliferation of epithelial tissue subsequently seeded post exposure?\n\n\n2.    What is the rate of cell division that occurs within those first 24 hours?\n\n\n3.    How does exposure to nickel chloride impact gene expression in epithelial tissue across the different concentrations after 24 hours post exposure in vivo and 76 hours post seeding?\n\n\n# Suggestions for Experimental Design\n\nDr. Gardell's suggested modifications to design 09/01/23:\n\n-   Log distribution of the concentrations.\n\n-   qPCR should be left for follow up experiment with better defined (targeted) concentrations and time points. Do not snap freeze tissue for qPCR, alternatively use tissue for:\n\n\n  -  Primary epithelial cell culturing to address question regarding stress-induced evolution\n\n  -  Use for comet assay\n\n\n\nValerie (UCD) Suggestions 09/23/23: \n\n\n-   Seed tissue immediately after dissection to avoid lag time in TCM aliquot.\n\n\n-   Reduce scale for preliminary trial to avoid 9 hours of micro-dissection time.\n\n\n# Final Experimental Schematic\n\n![](v3_design.jpeg)\n\n\n## Notes and considerations\n\nWill not control for blastogenic stage at this time.\n\n-   If system is in C2 - D blastogenic stages, seed the primary buds\n\n-   If system is in A1-C1 stages, seed the parental zooids\n\nTissue seeding density\n\n-   5-9 zooids (one whole system) in one well.\n\nUsing well plates, however, we will need to control for evaporation more effectively, currently randomly lose anywhere from 30-50% of the media, drastically causing differences in the osmolarity of the wells.\n\n-   Improve humidity conditions\n\n-   Add a lot of media from initiation. 2 mL in each well.\n\n   -   Ideal to measure media quality.\n   \n-   Randomize well assignments\n\n\nCould be interesting to incorporate in future design, freezing tissue at the end of the exposure and then freezing after seeding. Evaluating differences in gene expression across those time points.\n\n# Experimental Planning\n\n## Animal Handling Prior to Exposure\n\nDivided animals into separate system, 3 days prior to start of exposure, 8 days acclimated to the recirculating system.\n\n## Randomize Treatment and Plate Assignments\n\nHere we will have R randomly assign each animal to a treatment and each treatment/animal to a different well on the plate. The idea here is to randomize placements as there may be variations in the well design.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(3455)\nplate_number_12_well <- c(rep(1, times = 12))\nwell_placements <- c(\"A1\", \"A2\", \"A3\", \"A4\", \"B1\", \"B2\", \"B3\", \"B4\", \"C1\", \"C3\", \"C2\", \"C4\")\nconditions <- c(\"Control R1\", \"Control R2\", \"Control R3\", \"Control R4\", \"5 mg/L R1\", \"5 mg/L R2\", \"5 mg/L R3\", \"5 mg/L R4\", \"45 mg/L R1\", \"45 mg/L R2\", \"45 mg/L R3\", \"45 mg/L R4\")\nanimal_id <- c(\"S177C001\", \"S178C001\", \"S160C001\", \"S162C001\", \"S167C001\", \"S181C001\", \"S180C001\", \"S154C001\", \"S148C001\", \"S147C001\", \"S149C001\", \"S158C001\")\nwell_assignments <- data.frame(\n  Plate_Number = sample(plate_number_12_well),\n  Well_Placements = sample(well_placements),\n  Conditions = sample(conditions),\n  animal_ID = sample(animal_id)\n)\nprint(well_assignments)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Plate_Number Well_Placements Conditions animal_ID\n1             1              A2 45 mg/L R4  S181C001\n2             1              B4  5 mg/L R1  S147C001\n3             1              B2 45 mg/L R3  S178C001\n4             1              B1  5 mg/L R4  S180C001\n5             1              A1  5 mg/L R3  S160C001\n6             1              A3  5 mg/L R2  S167C001\n7             1              A4 Control R3  S154C001\n8             1              C4 Control R1  S177C001\n9             1              B3 45 mg/L R1  S158C001\n10            1              C2 Control R4  S148C001\n11            1              C1 Control R2  S149C001\n12            1              C3 45 mg/L R2  S162C001\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#save assignments in csv for downstream use\nwrite.csv(well_assignments, file = \"pilot_random_assignments.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n![plate assignments](12.jpeg)\n\n## Nickel chloride dilutions\n\nCalculations for spiking artificial seawater.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
