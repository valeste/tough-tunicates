Below are the packages I need to parse through the data and create plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## for reading & writing data\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(readr)\n## for manipulating data\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n## for plotting\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\nThe data is already in a csv file format so all we need to do is read it in.\n\n### Step 1: Setting the working directory\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## data directory\ndata_dir <- here(\"posts\", \"post-with-code\", \"data\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Step 2: Reading in the data\n\nThe data is already in a \"tidy\" format, meaning all the variables I need are already in columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## reading in the data\ndf <- read.csv(here(data_dir, \"siscowet.csv\"))\n\n# renaming locID column to Location so that it can display this as my legend title down the line\ndf <- df %>% rename(Location = locID)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Step 3: Creating an exploratory figure\n\nI want to simply look at the trend of fish weight against fish length.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## exploratory plotting\n ggplot(data = df, aes(x = len, y = wgt)) +\n  xlab(\"Total Length (mm)\") +\n  ylab(\"Weight (g)\") +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/exploratory_df-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Step 4: Creating my expository figure\n\nI am interested in seeing the relationship of fish weights and lengths by the different catch locations.\n\nBelow I am plotting the length and weight data and color coding the points by the four locations. I also have overlapped a linear regression over my data per location with a 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## plotting by locations with the addition of a linear regression line\n  ggplot(data = df, aes(x = len, y = wgt, color = Location)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Total Length (mm)\", y = \"Weight (g)\") +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=TRUE, fullrange=FALSE, level=0.95, aes(fill =Location)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/expository_df-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
