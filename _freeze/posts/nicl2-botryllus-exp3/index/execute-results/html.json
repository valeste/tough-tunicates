Will reduce the number of replicates.\n\n## Randomize Treatment\n\nHere we will have R randomly assign each animal to a treatment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(3349)\n\nconditions <- c(\"Control R1\", \"Control R2\", \"Control R3\", \"5 mg/L R1\", \"5 mg/L R2\", \"5 mg/L R3\", \"45 mg/L R1\", \"45 mg/L R2\", \"45 mg/L R3\")\nanimal_id <- c(\"S295C001\", \"S290C001\", \"S291C001\", \"S287C001\", \"S275C001\", \"S277C001\", \"S283C001\", \"S301C001\", \"S286C001\")\ntreatment_assignments_exp3 <- data.frame(\n  Conditions = sample(conditions),\n  animal_ID = sample(animal_id)\n)\nprint(treatment_assignments_exp3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Conditions animal_ID\n1  5 mg/L R2  S275C001\n2  5 mg/L R3  S295C001\n3 Control R1  S277C001\n4 Control R3  S283C001\n5  5 mg/L R1  S290C001\n6 45 mg/L R3  S291C001\n7 Control R2  S286C001\n8 45 mg/L R1  S287C001\n9 45 mg/L R2  S301C001\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#save assignments in csv for downstream use as metadata\nwrite.csv(treatment_assignments_exp3, file = \"treatment_assignments.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Nickel Chloride Dilutions\n\nReview resources prior to handling nickel chloride:\n\n-   Nickel chloride [SDS](https://www.fishersci.com/store/msds?partNumber=AC270510050&productDescription=NICKEL%28II%29+CHLORIDE+HEXA+5KG&vendorId=VN00032119&countryCode=US&language=en).\n\n-   [Chemical resistance of gloves.](https://amo-csd.lbl.gov/downloads/Chemical%20Resistance%20of%20Gloves.pdf)\n\nAll handling of stock solution and treatments to be done in a chemical fume hood.
