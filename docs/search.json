    "text": "Current Research\nIn 2022, I dually joined the Gardell Lab at the University of Washington, Tacoma and the Roberts Lab housed in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) at the University of Washington, Seattle. As a graduate student researcher at SAFS, my current work is focused on identifying the constraints of in vitro cellular immortality in the marine invertebrate, Botryllus schlosseri. This project involves the implementation of procedures for systematic primary cell culture optimization across various somatic tissue types. Additionally, I am interested in the application of clastogenic stressors as a means of facilitating stress-induced cellular evolution in primary epithelial and hemocyte cultures of B. schlosseri. With this approach, I aim to both potentially promote spontaneous immortalization and investigate the cellular physiology of this resilient, invasive, colonial ascidian at the morphological and transcriptional levels of organization.\n\n\nBackground\nI graduated from the University of California, Davis in 2020 with a bachelor of science in Animal Biology where I completed a capstone project in the Connon Lab exploring the impacts of bifenthrin, a commonly employed insecticide, on the development and behavior of the endangered Delta Smelt. Upon graduating I continued my research work in the Connon Lab for an additional two years working across various projects investigating the effects of contaminant, pathogenic, thermal, and salinity stressors on native California vertebrate species.\n\n\nContact\nEmail: cvaldi@uw.edu\nOffice: School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, Fisheries Teaching and Research Building (FTR), Room 134\nMailing address: School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington, 1122 NE Boat Street, Room 116, Seattle, WA 98105"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Here I summarize key takeaways and implications from a paper that describes the establishment of the only aquatic invertebrate cell line. The author is Eder L. Hansen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\nHansen (1976) Hansen EL. A cell line from embryos of Biomphalaria glabrata Pulmonata Establishment and characteristics. Academic Press; Cambridge: 1976. Google Scholar.\n\n\n\nPaper Summary\nThis article describes the establishment and characteristics of the one of the only aquatic invertebrate cell line available to date. Hansen was able to derive a cell line from embryonic cells of a freshwater snail through spontaneous immortalization. Specifically, the author began cultured Bge (Biomphalaria glabrata embryo) 740 primary cultures over the course of a 2-year period through an array of methods. They describe Bge primary cultures as being tolerant to a wide variety of culturing media which made it initially difficult in determining an optimum method. Furthermore, they utilized existing information to supplement the media with the appropriate organic osmolytes like galactose. However, they determined that any range of compositions of the media could work as long as it was in an appropriate osmolality and pH ranges. The medium used for the primary culture that eventually went on to become a cell line was one of a simpler composition. Furthermore, they claim that early division of primary cultures, a technique that differs from those usually employed, should be utilized for other invertebrate tissue sources. By this they simply mean the early trypsinization of the primary cultures to disassociate and passage cells was the key to the selection method which led to their cell line.\n\n\nSo what?\nAlthough the organism they use is a freshwater invertebrate and not a marine invertebrate like my model organism Botryllus schlosseri there is still key approaches presented in Hansen 1976 which should be taken into consideration when approached the development of a cell line for my model organism.\nParticularly, what caught my attention was:\n\nThe early integration of trypsinization of primary cultures.\nThe tolerance of a wide range of culturing conditions for Bge primary cultures as early work on Botryllus schlosseri somatic primary cultures also demonstrated a similar tolerance.\nThe brief immersion of tissue in an iodine solution to rid the embryos of any amebas and micrometazoa. When culturing whole colonies of Botryllus schlosseri at the University of Washington, Tacoma, we find many microscopic organisms inhabiting the tissue and tunic of our field collected colonies. Currently, we are unable to successfully rear colonies in our recirculating seawater system and so we are considering extracting tissue from field colonies. In order to do so we need to be able to eliminate the microfauna parasitizing our colonies and I believe dipping those colonies briefly in an iodine solution may aid in this process."

Stage does not matter but document the day of dissection.\nRemove individuals from recirculating seawater system\nUse a razor blade to clean the glass slide\nSpray animal over sink with 70 % ethanol for 5 seconds or until glass slide is completely coated with ethanol\nRinse animal with autocalved artificial seawater until no ethanol is observable.\nPlace animal in 15 cm glass petri dish containing 60 mL of ASW-G.\nParafilm and perferoate petri dish\nLeave overnight for starvation on lab bench at room temperature.\nPrepare coated plates if needed for the next day.\n\n\n\n2. Tissue Dissection\n\nRemove colony from ASW-G.\nWash colony and substrate for 10 seconds with 30% ethanol.\nRinse colony with autoclaved artificial seawater\nImmerse colony in 15 cm diameter, glass dish filled with ~60 mL of ASW-PSA. For each new colony microdissection, rinse the 15 mL glass plate with 70% ethanol in triplicate, followed by triplicate rinse of ASW-PSA prior to refilling plate with more ASW-PSA.\nUnder stereomicroscope on lab bench take picture of entire colony (all zooids to be dissected with Excelis camera.\nRecord blastogenic stage, zooid number, and health score.\nUsing a pair of 31G syringe needles, peel open the tunic and remove buds. Buds in earlier stages of development (stage A) are more embedded in the tunic than degrading ones (TO). Be sure to not tear the bud itself, this can be done by gently carving the tunic around the bud and then using a blunt portion of the needle to roll the bud out.\nEvery time a bud is removed, place it in cell strainer that itself is also immersed in the same 20 mL of ASW-G. Use a clicker to keep track of the number of buds you collected.\nOnce you have collected a group of 5 or 10 buds in the cell strainer, rinse all buds for 5 seconds with 30% ethanol followed by a 5 second rinse with ASW-PSA.\nUsing sterile curved forceps, transfer the group of 5 or 10 buds to a labeled, 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of TCM.\nTransfer all tubes containing bud tissue to the biosaftey cabinet in TPS for cell seeding.\n\n\n\n3. Seeding tissue and cell maintenance\n\nIn the biosaftey cabinet, use a 1000 uL pipette tip aspirate into the solution to get the buds back into suspension and transfer to plastic 60 mm petri dish.\nUsing the same 1000 uL pipette tip transfer buds one at a time to a fresh culturing dish. Make sure to transfer only a small amount of liquid (about a drop) per bud.\nUsing the same pipette tip, remove any excess liquid from the culturing dish.\nWhile you repeat the above two steps with your other samples, let the dishes you previously seeded to dry for about ~5 minutes or until there is no visible liquid left.\nIf there is still liquid in culturing dish, use aspirator to remove any excess to make sure tissue sticks to dish.\nOnce all the wells are dry, add 2 mL of TCM to T25 flasks. Be sure to not touch the tip of the pipette to the wells and to have the lowest flow possible when adding in media to not agitate the tissue and have it unadhere from plate.\nIncubate cells at 20 C\nReplace 100% of the TCM every 2-3 days."

    "text": "Research Work Overview\n\nBackground and Rationale\nBotryllus schlosseri is a cosmopolitan, sessile, colonial species currently found in the shallow, temperate, coastal areas of all continents except Antarctica (Zwahlen et al. 2022). Each mature colony of B. schlosseri is composed of genetically identical modules, termed zooids, that are embedded in a gelatinous tunic and share a single vasculature system (Manni et al. 2019). B. schlosseri colonies begin life as free-swimming larva that then settle and metamorphoses into a single founding oozooid. Through blastogenesis, new blastozooids develop and are eventually organized into a colonial star-shaped system. Over the course of its life, a healthy B. schlosseri colony will continue through a weekly blastogenic cycle where entire generations of zooids are synchronously reabsorbed and replaced with new sets of blastozooids (Ricci et al. 2016; Manni et al. 2019). This species of Botryllus is of significant interest as an experimental model organism because of its life cycle, close phylogenetic relation to vertebrates, genomic data availability (Voskoboynik et al.2013), and ability to split systems into ramets that then may serve as genetic replicates in controlled experimental designs.\nPrevious research work exploring B. schlosseri cell line development have isolated primary cell cultures from the epithelial and blood tissue of lab-reared colonies (Rinkevich and Rabinowitz 1993, 1997; Rabinowitz and Rinkevich 2004a, 2011; Rabinowitz et al. 2009). However, all attempted primary cultures of B. schlosseri hit a state of cellular quiescence where cells stop dividing approximately 24 to 72 hours post-isolation due to a lack of proper nutrients and growth factors; ultimately leading to a loss of cell viability after 4 weeks in vitro (Rinkevich and Rabinowitz 1993; Rabinowitz and Rinkevich 2011; Terzi et al. 2016; Domart-Coulon and Blanchoud 2022). Given such limited life span and proliferative capabilities, there is a clear need to elucidate the ideal culturing conditions for primary cultures of this species prior to experimentally invoking mechanisms of stress-induced evolution.\n\n\nObjectives and Research Questions\nThe overarching goal of my masters thesis work is to identify changes in gene expression in isolated tissue of Botryllus schlosseri across the transition from in vivo to in vitro.\nObjective 1: Optimize primary culturing methodology for somatic tissues derived from Botryllus schlosseri.\n\nDo certain cell culture substrates and or media formulations improve cellular proliferation?\nHow does the source of the excised tissue, (ampullae versus primary bud versus adult zooid) impact proliferation?\nDoes the blastogenic stage of the animal effect monolayer output across these three tissue types?\n\n Figure 1. Highlighted in cyan are the extending ampullae of a mature Botryllus schlosseri, these organs are only available and visible when the animal is in optimum health. Previous studies have demonstrated the regenerative capacity of ampullae, removing the entirety of the zooid, primary buds, and secondary buds bodies but leaving the extending ampullae intact result in an ability for the whole system to regenerate. Highlighted in white are is a parental zooid, all zooids embedded in the tunic are clonal. Highlighted in yellow is a primary bud adhered to a parental zooid. Primary buds are the next generation of parental zooids that will finish developing and reach maturity within a week.\nObjective 2: Conduct in vivo and in vitro sublethal nickel chloride exposures on epithelial tissue of Botryllus schlosseri aiming to produce random clastogenic events that may promote cell division in vitro.\n\nDoes a sublethal in vivo exposure to the clastogenic compound nickel chloride promote proliferation of tissue excised post-exposure?\nHow does an in vivo exposure to nickel chloride differ to an in vitro challenge effect transcriptional gene expression?\n\n\n\nApproach\n\n\nMock up of anticipated results\nObjective 1\nTBD\nObjective 2\nH0: No difference in gene expression of stemness-related, apoptosis-related, and stress-related genes between control and various doses of nickel chloride in primary cultures of Botryllus seeded post exposure.\nH1: Exposure to nickel chloride will interrupt apoptosis pathways and promote stemness-related characteristics in exposed cell populations physiologically similar to malignant cancer cells."

Particularly, Tang 2020 was referenced in our discussion, where the author references the lack of collagen in the extracellular matrix environment of “non-vertebrates”, here they particularly only describing the lack of collagen in the non-vertebrate Drosophila.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sourced from Tang 2020 depicting a simplified view of the non-vertebrate versus vertebrate extracellular matrix experience.\n\n\nPhylogenetically, Drosophila are much more distant relatives to vertebrates than species in the taxa ascidian such as Botryllus schlosseri.\nFurthermore, Wei et al. 2017 and Rodriguez et al. 2019 do reference the presence of collagen in the tunics of both solitary and colonial species of ascidians. Particularly in quoting Rodriguez et al. 2019 for Botryllus schlosseri:\n\n“This tunic has a composition that includes four main macromolecules: collagens, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and cellulose.”\n\nFurthermore, Rabinowitz & Rinkevich 2004 have evidence of epithelial cells from Botryllus schlosseri adhering to and producing monolayers anywhere from 25-50% of the time when using collagen as their substrate.\n\n\nAnecdotal Observations\nDuring the refinement of my epithelial cell isolation protocol over the course of Spring - Summer 2023, I have only explored using Cultrex BME, Cultrex BME RGF, and collagen I once for each. However, no conclusions can be fully drawn from these experiences as I was still troubleshooting the protocol and improving my techniques.\nRelative to directly inoculating tissue on the plastic of the cell culture vessels, use of any of the above mentioned substrates increases a level of difficulty in getting the tissue to adhere. I believe the difference in adherence frequency is related to the alternative approaches utilized since with the use of coated substrates, protocols typically highly recommend to not allow the substrate to dry out. Currently my protocol for seeding epithelial tissue of Botryllus schlosseri involves the intense desiccation of the tissue to allow for near 100% adherence.\nAn alternative approach to improve adherence of the tissue without the use of desiccation would involve the reduction of media volume between the 0 and 24 hours post inoculation period.\n\n\nSelection of Potenital Substrates\n\nCollagen 1\nCultrex BME\nPotentially mixing fibronectin with collagen 1?"

A commonly used threshold is E ≤ 0.001, which suggests that you would expect to see a similar match in a random database of the same size less than once by chance. For more stringent analyses where you want highly reliable matches, you can set a lower E-value threshold, such as E ≤ 1e-5 (0.00001) or even E ≤ 1e-10 (0.0000000001).\n\n\n\nRetrieve Botryllus Sequence: You locate the matching sequence from the Botryllus genome by searching the “botznik-ctg.fa” file using the contig name you found.\nPrimer Design: Finally, we will use the extracted Botryllus sequence to design primers. We will design primers using IDT’s PrimerQuest Tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will be using SYBR Green for the qPCR we are conducting so when on PrimerQuest select qPCR Intercalating Dyes (Primers only)\n\n\nThis method allows us to leverage well-annotated gene data to find potential homologs in Botryllus, even when the genome may not be fully annotated. We will want to validate the primers and carry out experimental verification to confirm the presence and function of the genes in Botryllus schlosseri.\n\nPulling Botryllus schlosseri sequences\nIn order to access the sequences for the genes of interest (GOI) it will be easier for us to curl the complete transcripts fasta file now available on the Botryllus Genome Project website.\n\ncurl -o data/botznik-ctg.fa http://botryllus.stanford.edu/botryllusgenome/download/botznik-ctg.fa\n\nLet’s take a peak at the file we just downloaded.\n\nhead -n 10 data/botznik-ctg.fa\n\n&gt;botctg000019\nTGACTTGACTTGACTTGACTCGACTTGACTCGAGTCACCTCCAAAAAACGAGTGACTTGA\nCTTGACTCGAGTCACCTTTGAAAATCGATTGACTTGACTTGAGTCGAGTCAAAATCTGCA\nATGACTCGAGATGACTCGTGACTCGAAGGTAGTGACTTGATCCCAACACTGGTAGAGAGT\nACCTGACAAGGAAACGATTCTGAATAGGATGAAATGAACATTCGAATCGCGTCGCGAGGC\nCATTCTGAATGGGATGTCAACACAGTCTGCTGGAGATTTACCCGATCTTGATCGATGCGC\nATTGGGTACCGTAGGTATAAAGCAGTGTTATGATCAAGTCACAGACGGCACGTAAAACGA\nCTTTGGTAAGGAAAGTGAGAGCTCCACAGACGCTGATGTGGGTTGCCACTTCTGCAGGTG\nTGCATAAAGCGCTGGTGAAATGTCTTGTATTTGCAGCTCCATTATTTGATAAACCTCGTT\nTTAGTCCAATCGCTTCTTAATGAACATTTTGAGCTTTATGACCTAACCAGGAAAATGTGA\n\n\nCreate an empty extracted_sequences.fasta file\n\ntouch output/extracted_sequences.fasta\n\nNow let’s pull the sequence for the top hit contig.
